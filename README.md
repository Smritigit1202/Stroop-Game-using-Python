# 🎨 Stroop Effect Game

A fun and challenging cognitive game built with Python and Pygame to test your brain's ability to process conflicting information (based on the Stroop Effect).

## 🧠 What is the Stroop Effect?

The Stroop Effect is a psychological phenomenon where your brain slows down when processing mismatched information — like seeing the word "Red" written in blue color and being asked to name the **color** rather than the **word**.

This game brings that challenge to life!
